## About this fork

Just a tiny fork made by tetram26745_62 to support more versions. Original work [here](https://github.com/hibiii/Blahaj)

## Building

Building? 🙂

Blåhaj Mod doesn't have a very well structured build system — in fact, each mod platform should have its own `build.gradle`, and is its own subproject. If you want detailed instructions...

	cd platform-${loader}-${version}
	./gradlew build

If you'd like a one-liner that builds everything, then `for platform in $(ls -d platform-*); do pushd "$platform"; ./gradlew build; popd; done` on the root of the project (POSIX sh only or compatible).
